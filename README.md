# BookApp-SwiftUI
App built in SwiftUI displaying books from a local JSON file. The initial screen will show a list of tappable cards, which will then navigate to a more detailed view of the book where the user can favourite the book, as well as rate it. The information is persisted in the app. By tapping the book in the detail view the user will be able to read the book itself. The page that the user is on will also persist.
